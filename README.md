# AssignmentGame


This is the repository for my Object Oriented Programming christmas assignment. I will be trying to create the traditional 
Tetris game for my assignment.
The game, if not already known, consists of moving shaped blocks that the user must drop down the screen and position.
If the blocks reach the top of the screen then the game is over. 
If the blocks form a line the whole way across the screen or many lines across the screen they will be deleted or erased. 
One shape will fall at a time and the next one will only start once the previous one has landed. 
The user has control over the blocks. In my project they will use up down right left keys 
i have added a hard down function and that is controlled by the space bar and the block speeds to the bottom of the screen.
